# Personal_Projects

Hello!

I am AJ Romero.

Passionate about bringing people and data together.  Experience building sustainable, scalable, self-service analytics platforms at large Fortune 500 companies, as well as hyper growth startups.  Drawn to leadership positions that provide the freedom to ensure that things are done correctly.  Enjoy delivering swift, immediate progress balancing speed and quality; unintimidated by rapid change or improvisation.
